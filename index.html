<h1>Healthy Living</h1>
            <p>
            Healthy living is having the opportunity, capability and motivation to act in a way that positively affects your physical and mental well-being. Paying attention to what you eat, being physically active, and learning more about your food and yourself can help you meet your health goals.

            Exercise strengthens your heart and improves your circulation. The increased blood flow raises the oxygen levels in your body. This helps lower your risk of heart diseases such as high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, and heart attack. Regular exercise can also lower your blood pressure and triglyceride levels.
                <br>
                Whatever your age, there's strong scientific evidence that being physically active can help you lead a healthier and happier life. People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing many long-term (chronic) conditions, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and some cancers.

                A healthy diet is a diet that maintains or improves overall health. A healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate food energy.
A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no processed food or sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a non-plant source of vitamin B12 is needed for those following a vegan diet.
A balanced diet is a diet that contains differing kinds of foods in certain quantities and proportions so that the requirement for calories, proteins, minerals, vitamins and alternative nutrients is adequate and a small provision is reserved for additional nutrients to endure the short length of leanness.

Why balanced diet is important?

A balanced diet supplies the nutrients your body needs to work effectively. Without balanced nutrition, your body is more prone to disease, infection, fatigue, and low performance. Children who don't get enough healthy foods may face growth and developmental problems, poor academic performance, and frequent infections.

               Good personal hygiene involves keeping all parts of the external body clean and healthy. It is important for maintaining both physical and mental health.
In people with poor personal hygiene, the body provides an ideal environment for germs to grow, leaving it vulnerable to infection.
On a social level, people may avoid a person with poor personal hygiene, which may result in isolation and loneliness.

<h3 class="text-capitalize">Types of personal hygiene</h3>
   <p class="text-muted text-left text-success">              
There are many types of personal hygiene.
The following list is a good starting point for someone looking to build a personal hygiene routine:
                </p>
<h3 class="text-capitalize">Dental</h3>
             <p class="text-muted text-left text-success">
Dental hygiene involves more than just having white teeth. A good dental hygiene routine can help prevent issues such as gum disease and cavities. It can also prevent bad breath.
                </p>
<h3 class="text-capitalize">Body</h3>
     <p class="text-muted text-left text-success">           
Several million sweat glands cover the human body. When bacteria break down sweat, the process creates a smell or body odor.
Washing the body will help prevent skin irritation, as well as removing the bacteria that cause body odor. Washing the hair removes oil and keeps a person looking clean and fresh.
                </p>
<h3 class="text-capitalize">Hand washing</h3>
                <p class="text-muted text-left text-success"> 
Regular hand washing is one of the best ways to avoid spreading communicable diseases.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source recommend washing the hands at certain times:
•	before, during, and after preparing food
•	before eating food
•	before and after looking after anyone who is vomiting or has diarrhea
•	before and after treating a cut or wound
•	after going to the bathroom
•	after changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet
•	after blowing the nose, coughing, or sneezing
•	after touching garbage or dirty surfaces or objects
•	after handling pets or pet-related items, such as food
                </p>
<h3 class="text-capitalize">Nails</h3>
                 <p class="text-muted text-left text-success"> 
Fingernails may harbor dirt and germs, contributing to the spread of bacteria. It is easier for dirt and germs to collect under longer nails, so keeping them short can help reduce the risk of spreading infections.

                Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. It is all about how people think, feel, and behave. People sometimes use the term “mental health” to mean the absence of a mental disorder. Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health.
